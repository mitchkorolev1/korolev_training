# Mitch Korolev

Hi there! My name is Mitch Korolev. I love the show *Survivor*, I've applied for the show several times. When I started in R, I was terrified of it, but now I'm getting used to it.

## One truth, one lie

I have never pole vaulted in my life. Last field season, a typhoon ran through our camp and nearly sent me to the **hospital**. Yuck.


```{r}
x <- 4*3

```

```{r}

y <- 3*4*5-9

z <- 6*7-8881

c <- 9 - 8

d <- 66*87
```
